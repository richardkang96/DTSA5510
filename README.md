This is a repo containing the Jupyter Notebook for my final project for my Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning class, part of the University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program. It als contains a link to the video presentation on YouTube. The goal of my project was to group customers together from a dataset found on Kaggle called "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" using methods such as K Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
